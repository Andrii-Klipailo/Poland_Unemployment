![dashboard-main](https://github.com/Andrii-Klipailo/Poland_Unemployment/blob/main/images/img_1.jpg)

## Overview
This project presents an analysis of unemployment trends in Poland over the past 10 years (2015–2025).
The analysis is broken down by:
- Voivodeships (regions)
- Rural and urban areas
-	Gender
The goal was to identify patterns, disparities, and long-term dynamics of unemployment across different socio-economic groups.
Tools & Technologies used:
-	Data source: GUS (Statistics Poland)
-	Data processing: SQL & Power Query
-	Visualization: Power BI (interactive dashboard)

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project were:
-	Analyze unemployment trends in Poland over the last decade.
-	Compare unemployment rates across voivodeships.
-	Examine differences between rural and urban areas.
-	Explore gender-based disparities in unemployment.
-	Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for easy exploration.

## Methodology
1.	Data Collection
-	Unemployment statistics obtained from GUS (Statistics Poland).
2.	Data Processing
-	Data cleaned & transformed using SQL queries.
-	Further refined in Power Query.
3.	Visualization
-	Processed data loaded into Power BI.
-	Designed an interactive dashboard with filters by region, gender, and area type.

Wielkopolskie → Lowest unemployment rate

![screen_7](https://github.com/Andrii-Klipailo/Poland_Unemployment/blob/main/images/screen_7.jpg)

Mazowieckie → Highest number of unemployed people

![screen_8](https://github.com/Andrii-Klipailo/Poland_Unemployment/blob/main/images/screen_8.jpg)

Lubuskie → Lowest number of unemployed people

### Additional insights

Gender disparities appear mainly in urban areas.

Seasonal trend: Unemployment peaks at the beginning of the year, then decreases over the following months.

## Findings and Conclusion

Over the last decade, Poland has shown a consistent decline in unemployment, with both structural and demographic improvements:

- Total unemployed dropped from **~1.8M to ~0.8M** (over 50%).

- The unemployment rate fell from **7.8% to 3.8%**.

Still, notable disparities remain:

- Women exceed men among the unemployed by ~70K annually (except in Podlaskie voivodeship).

- The rural–urban gap halved (200K → 100K), though Silesia remains most divided.

- Podkarpackie shows the **highest rate**, while Wielkopolskie **the lowest**.

- Mazowieckie has the **largest unemployed population**, while Lubuskie the **smallest**.

- Unemployment follows a **seasonal cycle**, peaking early each year.

**In summary**, Poland has made strong progress in reducing unemployment, yet gender, regional, and rural–urban imbalances persist. These insights can guide policymakers toward targeted support and help businesses understand regional labor dynamics.
